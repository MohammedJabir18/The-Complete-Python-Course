    "## The Importance of Comments in Code Documentation\n",
    "Comments serve as a form of documentation, providing insights into the rationale and functionality of the code. They enhance collaboration among developers, act as a reference for future modifications, and assist in troubleshooting. Well-commented code is not just a set of instructions; it's a communicative and educational tool for both present and future developers."

    "### Best Practices for Writing Meaningful Comments\n",
    "Writing effective comments is an art that involves balancing clarity, conciseness, and relevance. Here are some best practices to keep in mind:\n",
    "1. Be Clear and Concise: Comments should convey information succinctly. Avoid unnecessary details and focus on explaining complex or non-intuitive sections.2. Update Comments Alongside Code Changes: As your code evolves, make sure to update comments accordingly. Outdated comments can lead to confusion.\n",
    "3. Use Comments for Clarification, Not Redundancy: Comments should add value. If your code is clear on its own, avoid adding redundant comments that merely restate what the code does.\n",
    "4. Comment Tricky or Non-Intuitive Code: If a particular piece of code is not immediately obvious in its purpose or functionality, use comments to clarify the intent.\n",
    "5. Follow a Consistent Style: Adopt a consistent commenting style throughout your codebase. Whether you prefer complete sentences or short phrases, maintaining a uniform style enhances readability."
